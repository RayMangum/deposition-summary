                <h2>Overall Summary</h2>
                <p>This deposition volume (Volume II) continues the examination of Joseph Nadeau regarding his employment as a laborer at the Centredale site, operated by Metro-Atlantic Chemical Company and/or New England Container Company (NECC), during the early to mid-1960s. Having been previously deposed (in 2002 and 2008) and having testified at trial (in 2006), much of this session involved reviewing and confirming or clarifying that prior testimony, often prompted by examiners presenting transcripts or exhibits.</p>
                <p>A recurring theme is Mr. Nadeau's admittedly "fuzzy" or "foggy" memory of events occurring approximately 50 years prior. He often deferred to his prior, closer-in-time testimony (particularly from 2002 and 2006) as likely being more accurate than his current independent recollection. However, he did provide present-day descriptions and clarifications, especially when guided by a site map marked during his 2008 deposition (Exhibit 8).</p>
                <p>Key areas explored include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Timeline of Employment:</strong> Worked part-time summer jobs (~1962-1965) while in high school. Believes NECC work was ~'62/'63, Metro-Atlantic primarily '64-'65, ending August 1965 upon military draft.</li>
                    <li><strong>Site Operations & Layout:</strong> Used a site map (Exhibit 8) to identify and describe functions of: office, process areas, shipping, outdoor storage tanks, indoor filter presses (distinct "Reserve Salt" and "40-S"), separate maintenance/salt drying building, the "Texas Tower" (associated with hexachlorophene), and extensive drum handling areas (loading, warehouse, paint station, burn pit/furnace, wash station, outdoor storage, "dump" area).</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste Handling & Discharges:</strong> Described basement French drains for washdowns. Reaffirmed prior testimony that solid wastes (filter cake, chipped material) likely went into an on-site Dumpster with empty bags. Confirmed prior testimony about removing plastic liners from drums at NECC, which were temporarily discarded on the ground, collected, and potentially disposed of in the dump area. Consistently maintained (based on prior testimony and current recall) that basement wash water via French drains went "outside" towards the tailrace/river, not a sewer. Clarified that while initially calling his observation of the discharge point an "assumption" in 2002, he now recalls actually seeing the discharge exit the building. Confirmed observing the tailrace become murky at times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hexachlorophene:</strong> Stood by prior testimony estimating hexachlorophene manufacture in the "Texas Tower" for ~8-9 months before he left in August 1965.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationship Between Companies:</strong> Perceived Metro-Atlantic and NECC as interconnected operations under related families (Buonannos), sharing resources like "interchangeable" maintenance staff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Limitations:</strong> Emphasized role as a laborer, lack of chemical knowledge (didn't recognize "dioxin" term), and no knowledge of corporate structure, accounting, or property lines.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>Overall, the deposition aimed to solidify Mr. Nadeau's recollections, often via confirmation of prior sworn testimony, regarding operational practices, site layout, and waste handling. The testimony highlighted both the specific details he could recall or confirm and the admitted limitations of his memory and knowledge after five decades. Frequent objections were raised by counsel regarding vagueness, leading questions, foundation, and the use of prior testimony.</p>

                    <h3>Examination by Mr. Pirozzolo (Emhart)</h3>

                    <h4 id="theme-pirozzolo-objective">Examiner's Objective & Success Assessment</h4>
                    <p>Mr. Pirozzolo aimed to establish the timeline of Mr. Nadeau's employment, confirm details from his prior deposition (Exhibit 1) and trial testimony regarding specific operations (hexachlorophene production, waste handling), clarify the physical layout and processes using a site map (Exhibit 8), and probe his observations of discharges from the facility's French drains. Mr. Pirozzolo was largely successful in having Mr. Nadeau confirm his prior testimony on key points and effectively used the site map (Exhibit 8) to elicit detailed descriptions of operational areas. However, the witness frequently qualified his answers due to the passage of time ("fuzzy," "foggy memory," "guessing"), sometimes relying more on the presented prior testimony than independent recall. Mr. Pirozzolo also highlighted a potential evolution in the witness's certainty regarding whether he directly *saw* discharges versus assuming they occurred.</p>

                            <blockquote>A. I think the last two stints were at Metro-Atlantic. I think '64 through '65 was at Metro for sure. '63, '64 may have also been with Metro-Atlantic. Not too sure of that, and then '62 I believe was -- '62, '63 was the New England Container.<span class="page-ref">(p. 152)</span></blockquote>

                             <blockquote>Q. It would be your testimony that on December 17, 2002 you testified truthfully to the best of your recollection? A. Yes, I did.<span class="page-ref">(p. 156)</span></blockquote>
                             <blockquote>(Reading prior testimony) "Answer: I was there about a year full time. I'm guessing maybe eight, nine months maybe. It wasn't there full time.

                     <p>Ms. Baroni aimed to confirm the consistency of Mr. Nadeau's trial testimony regarding discharges going "outside" and to establish that the vast majority of his work occurred indoors. She achieved these objectives efficiently; the witness confirmed the trial testimony excerpts and agreed that most of his Metro-Atlantic work was inside.</p>

                      <ul>

                     <p>Mr. Bryan sought to firmly establish the timeline of employment, clarify the "interchangeable" employees concept, elicit more detail about the Texas Tower's appearance, confirm prior testimony about observing discolored/murky water in the tailrace, and explore the handling of plastic drum liners at NECC. He succeeded in confirming dates using prior testimony, clarifying that "interchangeable" primarily referred to maintenance staff, obtaining a physical description of the Texas Tower, confirming observations of murky water (while adding context of clear water days), and confirming the process for handling drum liners.</p>
